A demonstration D3 project, shamelessly ripping off Gapminder. Go to the "Commits" tab to see the step-by-step process by which the chart was created.

## Getting Started

In order to view the project in a browser, we need to set up a web server for the contents of the projects folder.

If you have a computer with Python installed (machines running Mac OS X do by default), this can be done by running the following command in the Terminal (you'll need to navigate to the project directory on your computer using the [`cd` command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) first):

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now you can view the project by opening [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Refresh after editing the code to see the changes.
